###### Good Afternoon everyone. My name is Joshua, and I'm here with Krrish and Manav, we’re presenting on the Adapter Design Pattern in Java. An Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible classes to work together by introducing a middle layer ie a target interface, without modifying either the client code or third-party code. In real-world projects, this problem commonly appears during integration such as when a client expects a method like pay(int amount) but a third-party library provides makePayment(double money). Even though both perform the same function, they can’t communicate directly because their interfaces don’t match. Without a proper solution, this leads to tightly coupled client code, messy if-else logic, and difficulty adding future integrations. The Adapter Pattern solves this by acting as a translation layer between the client and the existing class. A simple analogy is the human body: the brain issues a command, the muscles perform the action, and the nervous system acts as the bridge that converts the command into a signal the muscles understand. Similarly, an adapter converts the client’s request into a format the existing class can execute, keeping the system clean, reusable, and scalable.
