Default Exception Handler
1. If u have try-catch block then the catch block with super class Extension then that serves as default exception Handler.
2. if no try catch then JVM has a default exception handler.


Four things the default exception handler of JVM does :
1. printing name of exception
2. reason of the exception if any msg passed
3. stack trace prints ie order in which method is called
4. terminate program


Finally Block Rules:
 Runs even if exception occurs
 Runs even if return is in try/catch
❌ Does NOT run if System.exit() is called...itll terminate current program under execution
❌ Does NOT run if JVM crashes


Can we have a try catch without finally? -> yes
Can we have a try finally without catch? -> no...its mandatory without it exceptions are not handled and program is terminated

Exceptions have a heirarchy:
RuntimeException handles Arithmetic Exception....
therefore whenever we put multiple catch-blocks it should be in heirarchical error:

Throwable is able to handle any excpetion..but it is an anti pattern..

if we have common logic for multiple exceptions ->
then we do the following : we use 'pipeline' symbol '|' 
catch(NULLPointer|Arithmetic Exception e)

Anti pattern :
Never Gulp exceptions ... ie never do just try..catch (Exception e) without writing anything inside the catch block as well..
coz now program will never terminate.. u wont come to know what has gone wrong in the program...

We can have a try-catch block inside a try catch block..
we can also have finally inside
even finally can have a try catch block inside it.
