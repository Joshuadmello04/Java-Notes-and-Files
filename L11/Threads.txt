Multithreading..
1. only load 1 process..then releas resources and then switch between threads..
2. if we go for multitasking..every process' resources have to be separately allocated..
but in Multithreading only 1 process..1 set of resorces and all threads share same resource...thus less resources needed

Ex of Multithreading:
many ppl go to office..if 100 ppl travel from x to y
acc to multitasking : 10 ppl come in 10 cars separately
if 100 ppl come in 100 cars -> more traffic on road..
every car will need its own resources..more costly

acc to Multithreading : now if 100 ppl sit in 1 bus...resource shared and less costly and efficient utilization of resource
and lesser time taken as no traffic.ie 99 cars reduced

just extending Threads doesnt make class a thread we need to put in a run() method
and call obj.start()..now itll behave like multi threads

To create thread : 
1. extend threads..implement runnable
2. override the run() method
3. call start() to the thread...this is when thread is created

Why specifically run() method only :
CPU needs to know which method is multithreaded..
and itll know from where it has to continue execution of each thread

Thread LifeCycle:
1.  Does Not Exist State (before creation of thread)
    ||
    ||...(start() is called)
2.  Runnable State (threads in a queue)
    ||
    || (CPU will select one thread)
3.  Running State
    ||
    ||
    (Execution over)
4.  Dead State/ Terminated State
